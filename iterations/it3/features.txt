Previously we essentially tried to prevent the problem of gradients becoming too small. Now we will also implement changes to prevent them from becoming too large.
The reason for these changes is that I have encountered overflow warnings during training with some combinations of training parameters.

The changes I will therefore implement are the following:
- L2 regularization
- Gradient clipping
