Most basic implementation of an ANN, both nodewise and layerwise.
The only extra feature is early stopping with patience for automatic training durations.

This model only works as intended (reducing loss) for some seeds. 
The main problem with this implementation is that of dying neurons, where weights of neurons are set to 0 because of the ReLU activation function.
